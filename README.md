# bcpy
You just stumbled upon a set of python sources that I made in order to analyse EEG data from brain-computer interface (BCI) setups. The main library is bcpy/bcpy.py and a few real-world examples lie in bin/ directory. Supported format is a CSV file, specifically these falling out from Openvibe should work well (signal exports, stimulations, features).

I plan to make a proper piece of software with docs and everything out of this pile of code; however, so far you can benefit only from docstrings in main class methods and underlying functions.
